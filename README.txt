This is the master branch of Motr (MOuse TRacker)
======

Motr is a collaborative project between Janelia Farm and Caltech to
create a reliable, long-term multiple mice tracker.

Motr incorporates code from the Ctrax project
(http://ctrax.sourceforge.net), described in:

Branson, K., Robie, A. A., Bender, J., Perona, P. & Dickinson,
M. H. (2009). High-throughput ethomics in large groups of
Drosophila. Nature Methods 6:451-457. DOI:10.1038/nmeth.1328

In particular, the Motr GUI for manually correcting tracks is a fork
of the Ctrax FixErrors GUI for correcting fly tracks.

All code in Motr is licensed under the GNU General Public License,
