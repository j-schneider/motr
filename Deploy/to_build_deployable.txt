1.  Make sure all the Motr stuff is on the path, perhaps by using
    fnSetupFolders().

2.  In Matlab, cd into this dir (Deploy).

3.  Run buildStandaloneExecutables(), which should generate motr.exe
    and catalytic.exe in this directory (Deploy).

4.  Obtain the Matlab Compiler Runtime 8.2
    (MCR_R2013b_win64_installer.exe) installer, and put it in this directory (Deploy).

5.  Compile the motr.nsi install script using the Nullsoft Install System v2.35 or
    above.  This should create install_motr.exe, which is the deployable.

The installer is designed to work on 64-bit Windows 7 or above,
although I haven't tested it on Windows 8.
